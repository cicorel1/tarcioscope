# Roadmap

This project is part of a bigger project to send a balloon to stratosphere so me and my friends can say we did something that was cool.

Thus it is the goal of this project to evolve.

One of the next things planned to work with servos to move the telescope to a point in the sky.

Considering my current skill level in Python, this will definitely be a hard task but hey, I'm persistent!

If you have any ideas I would be happy to hear from you.

Cheers :beers:
